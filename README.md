Covid19 Detector using chest_xray pictures:
Participated in a Covid19 Detector team project, where we:

• Created a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model to detect COVID19 disease using chests X-rays.

• Prepossessed the X-ray data-set images, then applied normalization and standardization using Numpy library in Python, and used TensorFlow to apply the CNN model.

• Achieved an accuracy of 99% using 30 epochs and 100 batch size.
